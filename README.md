CalcInterpreter
===============

A calculator interpreter written in Python.
Allows for basic math operations, variable assignment (peristent), etc.
Uses Abstract Syntax Trees (kind of).
Preserves order of operations
Has some syntactic sugar that you would expect.

Does not (yet) support constants, trig, etc.

(often) ignores garbage characters and unmatched parens (can figure it out most of the time)
